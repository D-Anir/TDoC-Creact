## About the project :

This is a transpiled esolang that is made to explore the boundaries of computer language design. The esolang Creact works with HTML tags to implement logic-based procedural programming in an HTML-adapted design. The Creact code is transpiled using various STL containers provided in the C++ programming language to seamlessly convert the esolang to a C file that can be compiled to view the desired result.

## Tech Stacks used :

C, C++ , MakeFile/Bash scripting(for compilation purposes)

## Aim :

To understand & experiment with computer language design, understand raw parsing concepts, and understand applicative methods of various containers in C++, and at last, have fun.

## Takeaway :

* Had fun implementing various new features using C++ STL and string manipulation techniques. I learned a lot during the entire week of the event.
* Secured Top3 (3rd) in TDoC (Ten Days of Code), 2021 organised by GNU/LINUX Group, NIT Durgapur for this project.
